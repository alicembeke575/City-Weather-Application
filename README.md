In this project, I will build a weather application that will enable the user to search and get real-time weather information of their current city or even their city of choice using.

My API of choice will be OpenWeatherMap using the following API call: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}
I will call this API to show the current weather data for different cities depending on what the user searches for.

The single page application will have the following features;
•	Input City Name
This is where the user will input their city name of choice that they intend to know the current weather at that particular time.

•	Search Button
On clicking this button, the backend will interact with the weather API that will then find the city named and be able to return its current weather information.

•	Display Area
Inside this area is where the returned information will be displayed for the user to see.

Challenges Expected.
•	I expect to be constrained with limited data available since the API I will be using will be of free subscription because I can’t afford to pay for the premium features.
•	Since I’m using a desktop computer, I may experience some issues with electricity blackouts that may limit my speed with the completion of the project.

How I meet the requirements of the project.
•	The app’s frontend is built using HTML/CSS/JS with an interface that make it easy for interactivity to access data from a public API.
•	Communication format used is JSON.
•	The app runs entirely on a single page with no redirects.
•	The app in cooperates a search interactivity as well as events listeners such as click, submit, fetch from an API.
•	The code using in writing the app is not in any way repetitive.
